# üîù**yant** - _**Y**et **A**nother **N**vidia **T**op_ 

![Python 3.5+](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.5%2B-brightgreen.svg)

If there is one thing we don't have enough of, it's the amount of ways to make `nvidia-smi` actually readable. 

Here's ***Y**et **A**nother **N**vidia **T**op* (or `yant`) written in simple, straightforward python.

## Features
- Based on `nvidia-smi` but is more human readable
- Ability to **view the current command** ran on GPUs for process control
- **Colored outputs** with *lots of* options for customization
- No more `NVIDIA GeForce ...`! `yant` gives the option to toggle gpu name display
- ...and many more to come

## Installation

First, install the required `termcolor` package with 

```bash
pip3 install termcolor
``` 

Then, you may clone this repository with 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Cveinnt/yant.git
```

Next `cd yant` into the directory and use `yant` with 

```bash
python3 yant.py
```

Feel free to use flags to customize the outputs. 

**(Optional)** To make `yant` more `top`-like, use the `watch` utility: `watch -c python3 yant.py`. 

### **Recommended** 
If you want, you can just copy 
```bash
alias yant="watch -c python3 /path/to/yant/yant.py"
```
to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` file, where `/path/to/yant/` is the output of `pwd` when you are in `yant`'s directory.
**Don't forget to `source ~/.zshrc`!** Then you can just run 
```bash
$ yant
```
and watch the magic happens.

**If `yant` is useful to you, please star ‚≠êÔ∏è it to let more people know ü§ó, or consider contributing to it!**

## Usage

    $ python3 yant.py

      Print current GPU utilization with better formatting and color support.

      --length [int]                   Adjust length of printed command used by different 
                                       GPUs. `[int]` should be an integer that represents 
                                       the desired amount of characters to print.
                                       Default: print first 100 characters (int=100).
      
      --high [float]                   Set threshold value for what is considered a high 
                                       GPU usage. Should be a float value between 0 and 1.
                                       Default: 0.8

      --low [float]                    Set threshold value for what is considered a low 
                                       GPU usage. Should be a float value between 0 and 1.
                                       Default: 0.1
      
      --high-color [str]               Customize color output for what is considered a high 
                                       GPU usage. Should be a string.
                                       Default: 'red'

      --mid-color [str]                Customize color output for what is considered a mid-level 
                                       GPU usage. Should be a string.
                                       Default: 'yellow'

      --low-color [str]                Customize color output for what is considered a low 
                                       GPU usage. Should be a string.
                                       Default: 'green'
                                       
      --show-gpu                       Toggle GPU name disply. Sometimes `nvidia-smi` 
                                       does not display the full GPU name. Use this flag to 
                                       display the full name. Only available to GeForce GPUs. 


Outputs are color coded, specifically: 
- red means: `GPU utilization` or `GPU memory` >= `high`
- yellow means: `low` <= `GPU utilization` or `GPU memory` < `high`
- green means: `GPU utilization` or `GPU memory` < `low`

As shown above, you may also change the colors if you'd like. Here's a list of available colors: `["grey", "red", "green", "yellow", "blue", "magenta", "cyan", "white"]`

*Note:* for backward compatibility, `nvidia-smi | python3 yant.py` is also supported.

*Note:* running inside a container (docker, singularity, ...), `nvidia-smi` can only see processes running in the container.
